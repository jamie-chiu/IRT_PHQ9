  The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a commonly-used depression measurement tool. The ratings on each question is often treated as continuous, summed to a total score, and then compared against different cut-offs to determine a respondent's depression severity. However, the PHQ-9 is an ordinal scale where each question has four rank-ordered responses - "Not at all", "Several days", "More than half the days", and "Almost every day". The following report is an exploration of using an ordinal-appropriate model to analyse the PHQ-9. More specifically, the Graded Response Model from Item Response Theory is applied to examine the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9. The data comprises 2,177 responses to the PHQ-9, gathered from two open data sets. Overall, most of the items of the PHQ-9 has adequate discrimination and difficulty. Item 9 performed the worst, even participants with high depression did not always endorse it. Item 9 may be indicative of a related but separate latent trait instead of depression, and could be potentially excluded from the Patient Health Questionnaire. All analyses were carried out in R and the data and code are provided for reproducibility.

# Introduction

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a commonly-used 9-item rating scale used to measure depression severity [@kroenkePHQ9NewDepression2002]. The PHQ-9 is an ordinal scale that is often used as a continuous or interval scale -- that is, the responses are treated as if the distance between each option is equal. In the PHQ-9, each question asks how much you have experienced a particular symptom over the last 14 days, with rank-ordered responses being "Not at all", "Several days", "More than half the days", and "Almost every day". The ordinal nature of the response categories mean that distances between each response cannot be assumed to be equal. For example, the difference between “Not at all” and “Several days” may be much smaller in the respondent’s mind than the difference between “Several days” and “More than half the days”. Treating ordinal data as metric by summing across responses and computing a total score can be problematic [@liddellAnalyzingOrdinalData2018]. (The reader is advised to see @liddellAnalyzingOrdinalData2018 for an in-depth analysis into the errors and problems that can arise from treating ordinal data as metric.)

One alternative approach for analyzing ordinal rating scales such as the PHQ-9 that involves more than 2 categories of responses is the graded response model [@samejimaGradedResponseModel1997] from item response theory. Item response theory is a family of models that aims to look at the underlying latent traits which are driving test performance; and the graded response model is one such model that deals with ordered polytomous categories. This report outlines the analysis of the PHQ-9 scale using a graded response model.

The structure of this report is as follows: Using a real-world data set of PHQ-9 responses, assumptions for item response theory are explored and reported; then a graded response model is fit to the data set and the results are discussed. The data set and code are provided for reproducibility.

# Methods

## Participants

2,177 participants' responses to the PHQ-9 scale was obtained and combined from two data sets: the Brighten Study [@pratapRealworldBehavioralDataset2022] and the PERLA Project [@arrabalesPerlaConversationalAgent2020]. For the purpose of this report, only the PHQ-9 responses were used for analysis, and no participant demographic data was used. For ease of analysis, the PHQ-9 responses are stored as both ordinal (factored and ordered) as well as numerical. To access the data set:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

PHQ <- read_csv("PHQ9_data.csv")
# head(phq)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

kable(cbind(PHQ[1:5, 1:4], PHQ[1:5, 12:14]),
      col.names = c("ID", 
                    "Item 1 (num)", "Item 2 (num)", "Item 3 (num)",
                    "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"),
      align = "lcccccc",
      caption = "Responses are duplicated in ordinal and numerical values for ease of analysis.",
      format="latex",
      booktabs=TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
```

## Examining Fit using Metric Models

Using the numerical values of the PHQ-9 ratings, a normal distribution was fit over each item and the total sum (Figure 1 and 2).

(ref:plot1-caption) Ratings data from the PHQ-9 items are shown as histograms. Normal distributions from the metric model are superimposed on the data.

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:plot1-caption)"}
# plot histograms of each item
PHQ_num <- PHQ[, 2:10] # select only numerical subset
var_name <- colnames(PHQ_num) # get variable names

par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mar=c(3, 3, 3, 3)) # set display grid

for (i in 1:length(var_name)){
  x = as.numeric(unlist(PHQ_num[var_name[i]][,1]))
  # create histogram
  hist(x, prob = TRUE, breaks = seq(min(x-0.5), max(x+0.5), length.out = 10),
       ylim = c(0,1), main = paste("Item ", i), col = "#69b3a2")
  xfit <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = 2177)
  yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean=mean(x), sd=sd(x)) 
  lines(xfit, yfit, col="darkslategray", lwd=2) # add normal curve
}

```

(ref:plot2-caption) Sum ratings from the PHQ-9 items are shown as a histogram. A metric model normal distribution is superimposed over the data. The fit is poor, as the data histogram bars protrude above and below the normal distribution.

```{r, plot2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:plot2-caption)"}

# set x as sum score
x <- as.numeric(unlist(PHQ$SumScore))
  # create histogram
  hist(x, prob = TRUE, 
       breaks = seq(min(x), max(x)), 
       xlab = "Sum PHQ-9 Scores",
       main = paste(" "),
       col = "#69b3a2")
  # create normal distribution
  xfit <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = 2177)
  yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean=mean(x), sd=sd(x)) 
  # add curve to plot
  lines(xfit, yfit, col="darkslategray", lwd=2)

```



```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# gg density plot over histogram
PHQ_num %>%
  mutate(Sum = select(., Item1_num:Item9_num) %>% rowSums(na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sum)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, color = "darkslategray", fill = "#69b3a2", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_density()

```

## Examining Fit using Item Response Theory

### Assumptions Testing

Item response theory models must meet the following assumptions: unidimensionality, local independence, and monotonicity. Each of the assumptions will be discussed below and the statistical methods used to test for them described.

#### Unidimensionality
Unidimensionality assumes the items all assess the same one underlying latent trait variable. Unidimensionality was tested         using principal component analysis to check if only one principal could be sufficiently extracted. 


(ref:plot3-caption) Scree plot of principal component analysis. The first component explains almost 50% of the variance.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:plot3-caption)"}

# run PCA
PHQ_PCA <- PCA(PHQ_num, scale.unit = TRUE, ncp = 3, graph = FALSE)

# display eigenvalues
kable(PHQ_PCA$eig[1:9, 1:3],
      col.names = c("Eigenvalue", 
                    "% Variance Explained",
                    "Cumulative Variance"),
      digits = 2,
      align = "c",
      caption = "Principal Component Table of Eigenvalues.",
      booktabs=TRUE)

# scree plot
fviz_eig(PHQ_PCA, addlabels = F, ylim = c(0, 50),
         barfill = "#69b3a2",
         barcolor = "darkslategray",
         ggtheme = theme_classic(),
         xlab = "Components",
         main = paste(" "))

```

A principal component analysis revealed that 1 component explained about 50% of the variance. Examining the eigenvalues, the first component was the only eigenvalue >1, which is commonly used as a cutoff point for which components are retained. Thus, it can be argued that the assumption of unidimensionality is sufficiently met.

However, examining the contribution of variables (Figure 4), it appears that Item 9, which asks about thoughts of wanting to die, loads higher onto a different dimension than the rest of the items. 


(ref:plot4-caption) Contribution of variables towards principal component analysis based on cos2 value.
```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="(ref:plot4-caption)"}

# Color by cos2 values: quality on the factor map
fviz_pca_var(PHQ_PCA, col.var = "cos2",
             gradient.cols = c("#17201e", "#36564e", "#69b3a2"), 
             repel = TRUE, # Avoid text overlapping
             title = " ",
             ggtheme = theme_classic())

```


#### Local Independence
Local independence assumes the items are only related to the latent trait variable being measured and not to any other factors.    Local independence was evaluated using a single factor confirmatory factor analysis and examining the residual correlation         matrix. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was revealed to be 0.1. The cutoff for calculating the probability of a close fit is commonly suggested at 0.1. The comparative fit index (CFI) was shown to be 0.9. CFI assesses the relative improvement in fit of the model compared with the baseline model, with a suggest cutoff of 0.9. Thus, the assumption of local independence is sufficiently met. (For details on the analysis, please refer to the Appendix.)

#### Monotonicity
Monotonicity assumes that the probability of endorsing higher-ranked responses to the items correlates with increasing levels      of the latent trait variable (e.g. the probability of choosing "Almost every day" instead of "Several days" should correspond      to an increasing level of depression). Monotonicity was tested using a Mokken scaling technique. The fit of the mokken model was evaluated by calculating the scalability coefficient H per item - monotonicity was considered acceptable as the scalability coefficients for each item was >0.30, which is the suggested cutoff.

```{r, echo=F}

monotonicity.results <- check.monotonicity(PHQ_num)
table <- summary(monotonicity.results) # coeff H >= 0.3 for each item

# display eigenvalues
kable(table[1:9, 1],
      digits = 2,
      align = "c",
      caption = "Scalability Coefficient H for each PHQ Item",
      col.names = c("Coeff H"),
      booktabs=TRUE)
```


### Graded Response Model

Two graded response models - one with constrained parameters where one discrimination parameter was fixed across all times, and one with unconstrained parameters - was fitted to the data. 


```{r, echo=T, eval=T, results="hide"}

# fit GRM model
library(ltm)
PHQ_ordinal <- PHQ[, 12:20] # subset ordinal data
# constrained, i.e. discrimination parameter is held constant
mod1 <- grm(PHQ_ordinal, constrained = TRUE)
mod1
# non constrained model
mod2 <- grm(PHQ_ordinal)
mod2
# compare fit
anova(mod1, mod2)

```

The unconstrained model fared better even when accounting for additional parameters (p < 0.01). Thus, we will report on the unconstrained model from hereon. Table 4 displays the item thresholds and item discrimination parameters. 

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}

# table 4
table <- coef(mod2)
kable(table,
      digits = 2,
      align = "c",
      caption = "Item Thresholds and Discrimination Parameters for PHQ-9 Item",
      col.names = c("Threshold 1",
                    "Threshold 2",
                    "Threshold 3",
                    "Discrimination"),
      booktabs=TRUE)

```

(ref:plot5-caption) Item Operation Characteristic Curves. Each line corresponds to a category distinction (i.e. 1 corresponds to "Not at all" vs "Several days"; 2 - "Not at all / Several days" vs "More than half the days"; and 3- "Not at all / Several days / More than half the days" vs "Almost every day"). The x-axis corresponds to the latent trait measure, and y-axis depicts the probability of endorsing. Thus, for each line, the item threshold parameter will be at the latent trait measure at 50% probability.

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=7, fig.cap="(ref:plot5-caption)"}

par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mar=c(3, 2, 3, 2)) # set display grid
plot(mod2, lwd=1, type = "OCCu", ylim = c(0,1), cex.main = 0.8)

```

#### Item Threshold 

The PHQ-9 has 4 categories for responses, and so there are three threshold parameters: The first threshold indicates the latent trait variable measurement at which there is 50% probability that a respondent would endorse category 1 vs 2. For example, with Item 1, lack of interest, there is a 50% probability that a respondent would endorse either "Not at all" or "Several days" at -1.2 on the latent variable scale. On the other hand, with Item 6, feeling bad about oneself, the 50% probability of endorsing "Not at all" or "Several days" is at -0.7, which indicates a higher latent trait. The second threshold indicates the 50% probability of endorsing category 1 or 2 vs category 3; and the last threshold is category 1,2,3 vs category 4. 

The item threshold parameter is also often referred to as the item difficulty -- where a more "difficult" item requires higher latent trait in order to endorse it. For example, Item 9 is the most difficult, because to endorse "Almost every day" requires a latent trait measure of 7.7; which is higher than any other item. 

#### Item Discrimination

If item threshold can be conceptualized as the location along the latent trait measure, then item discrimination is characterized by the slope of the curve. An item is more discriminating if they are better at distinguishing respondents' latent trait measures based on the endorsed response. For example, Item 2, feeling depressed, has the highest discrimination parameter, and from Figure 5, Item 2 has the steepest slope. What this means is that with each step up or down on the latent trait measure, the probability of endorsing a particular response changes a lot more than for other items.

#### Item Information

The reliability of a measurement tool within item response theory is conceptualized as information -- that is, how much information each item reveals about the latent trait variable. Figure 6 plots the information provided by each item and the entire test. Item 9, wanting to die, and Item 8, moving slowly, provided the least amount of information; whereas Item 2, feeling depressed, provided the greatest amount of information.


(ref:plot6-caption) Information Function per Item and Test. Each line corresponds to how much information is provided per item. The second plot of the panel depicts the total information given by the entire test. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.height = 7, fig.cap="(ref:plot6-caption)"}

par(mfrow = c(2, 1)) # set display grid
# plot Item Information Function per item
plot(mod2, type = "IIC",
     main = "Item Information for Each Item",
     cex.main = 0.8,
     ylim = c(0,2))

# plot Test Information Function
plot(mod2, type = "IIC", items=0,
     main = "Test Information Function - All Items",
     cex.main = 0.8,
     ylim = c(0,10))

```


# Discussion

The typical use case of the PHQ-9 treats responses numerically; summing across all items to derive at a total score. Doing so assumes that each item is weighted similarly towards the final depression score -- that is, a respondent who scores "Several days" on both Item 2, feeling depressed, and Item 9, wanting to die, will have their responses be calculated as a 1 for each item. However, analyzing the PHQ-9 scale using item response theory shows a more nuanced picture: each item reveals different amounts of information about a respondent's depression, and different items do better at distinguishing among low levels of depression and higher levels of depression. Items 1-6 provides good amounts of information (>0.5) and has good discrimination and thresholds where a respondent's probability of endorsing a response corresponds well to the underlying latent trait measure. Item 9 in particular is did the least well - where most respondents have a high probability of endorsing lower-ranked categories even when depression is high. In the assumptions testing, Item 9 also had the lowest loading in the principle component analysis. An interesting future direction is to explore whether thinking about suicide is a separate dimension from depression, and whether the PHQ scale can be sufficient without including Item 9.
